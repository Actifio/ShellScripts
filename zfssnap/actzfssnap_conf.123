####   BEFORE WE BEGIN
#########################
####   0)  Install Actifio Connector on Solaris host  
####   1)  Create ZFS Snapshot on Solaris host using your own snapshotname like we set below:    zfs snapshot $snapshotname
####   2)  Create ZFS Clone on Solaris host using your own clonename like we set below:     zfs clone $snapshotname $clonename
####   3)  On Actifio, Do App Discovery on Solaris host, find the ZFS Clone as File system and learn APPID.  
####   4)  Protect the discovered APP but disable protection.  
####   Now create two files on host side,  this file with name:    actzfssnap_conf.10792   where 10792 is the APPID
####   Then rename zfsnapshot.sh to zfssnapshot.10792 and make it executable
####   Place both files in /act/scripts
####   Also setup SSH so that the script can SSH to Actfio and run udstask and udsinfo commands.


#  You need to change these variables
# these are Actifio side settings needed to send snapshot command to actifio
actusername=sun
actip=10.65.5.101

# this is the snapshot we will create on host side of source file system.  The only part you can choose is the  @backup part
snapshotname="rpool/export/home@backup"
# this is the clone we will create on host side of source file system.  You cannot change the pool name part but can change the clone name part.
clonename="rpool/snapshotbackup"

# this is a check value for maximum pool usage  it has to be a number less than 100.    
#  The higher the number the less space you will tolerate and still let the snapshot get created
#  so 10 means 10% used is the most you will allow and 95 means 95% used is the most you will allow
maxpoolusage=95
